I thought I’d post a short update about why I haven’t been blogging as much.

These past two months have been a whirlwind for me. I am looking for jobs and I have gotten some interest. I can’t say too much right now, but things are looking up.

The tweets that started it:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Still looking for a junior role! Full-stack pref. Working with React on front-end. People shy but am willing to learn. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DevDiscuss?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DevDiscuss</a></p>&mdash; Tiffany White 🤨👩🏾‍💻⚛️ (@TiffanyW_412) <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412/status/922997615230357505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2017</a></blockquote>


It was during a #DevDiscuss Twitter chat. Initially, Pablo Rivera tweeted to [Stephanie Hurlburt](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt) about getting me a job. She tweeted back to tweet to her my portfolio, resume, etc and that I am looking for work. She would then retweet it to her large following of potential employers and companies.

I did:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi! My name is Tiffany. Dev looking for junior role. My resume: <a href="https://t.co/08fd2Eknhe">https://t.co/08fd2Eknhe</a>. My GitHub: <a href="https://t.co/C6lGJ5N74V">https://t.co/C6lGJ5N74V</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sehurlburt?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@sehurlburt</a></p>&mdash; Tiffany White 🤨👩🏾‍💻⚛️ (@TiffanyW_412) <a href="https://twitter.com/TiffanyW_412/status/923000005035724800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 25, 2017</a></blockquote>



And awesome…things…started…happening.

That’s all I can really say but I have honestly just been trying to process what is happening and how, when it comes together and tries, the tech community is the best there is…
