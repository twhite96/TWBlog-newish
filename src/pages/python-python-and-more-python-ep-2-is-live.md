Brief podcast today to talk about my love affair with learning languages, [tutorial sites](https://helloburgh.me/2015/04/01/finding-tutorial-sites-and-sticking-to-them/) (and sticking to at **LEAST** two of them). Not much going on lately but I have picked up both going back to the gym and coding so there's that at least. Ha.

Enjoy.
