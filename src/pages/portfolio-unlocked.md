So I started the portfolio project on March 10th and finished it today. I had help from the Gitter chat but not as much as last time.

I took the example code and re-engineered it to fit what I wanted to do. I added an unordered list, a cover photo, a mailto: link and a few other things.

The thing I struggled with the most was horizontal scrolling on mobile with Bootstrap. When looking at the Pen on mobile, you had some overflow, which totally defeats the purpose of a responsive design! So I went to Google and found a few Stack Overflow articles and found the right media query along with some other css that I edited to fit my project. I used:
```css
@media screen and (max-width: 767px) {
  body {
  overflow-x: hidden !important;
}
.container {
   max-width: 100% !important;
   overflow-x: hidden !important;
   margin-left: auto;
   margin-right: auto;
   padding-left: 0px;
   padding-right: 0px;
   }
}
```
This allowed me to negated the overflow on the x axis part of the page which is horizontal. You essentially hide the overflow. But that wasnâ€™t enough. Adjusting the margins and padding really made the responsiveness on my iPhone so much better.

You can find the Pen below.
