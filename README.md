# test-trwblog

My personal blog. [Forked from Dan Abramov's overreacted](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io). Syntax theme based on [Luis Ramirez Gloom PrismJS Theme](https://github.com/luisramirez-m/prism-gloom-theme) with small tweaks.

To run locally, `yarn`, then `yarn dev`, then open https://localhost:8000.
